# 🚀 Gender Detection using OpenCV, CNN, Keras and TensorFlow

A real-time gender detection system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) built with TensorFlow/Keras and OpenCV.

## ✨ Features

- **Real-time Detection**: Live webcam gender detection
- **CNN Architecture**: Deep learning model for accurate classification
- **Face Detection**: Automatic face detection using cvlib
- **VPS Optimized**: Specialized scripts for server deployment
- **Performance Monitoring**: FPS tracking and training metrics

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system uses a CNN with the following layers:
- Convolutional layers with BatchNormalization
- MaxPooling and Dropout for regularization
- Dense layers for final classification
- Binary classification (Male/Female)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Local Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Train model
python train.py

# Run detection
python detect_gender_webcam.py
```

### VPS Deployment
```bash
# Upload to VPS and run installation
bash install_vps.sh

# Test setup
python3 test_setup.py

# Start training
python3 train_vps.py

- **Memory Usage**: Optimized for VPS environments

## 🌐 VPS Deployment

See [DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md) for detailed VPS setup instructions.

## 🎯 Usage

1. **Training**: Run `train_vps.py` to train on your dataset
2. **Detection**: Run `detect_gender_vps.py` for real-time detection
3. **Monitoring**: Use `test_setup.py` to verify installation

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

- Check [DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md) for common issues
- Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly
- Verify dataset structure and permissions
- Monitor system resources during training
